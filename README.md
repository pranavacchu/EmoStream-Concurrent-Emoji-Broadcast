# EmoStream: Concurrent Emoji Broadcast over Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview:
Emojis reflect the dynamic sentiments of fans in real-time. When Virat is batting, everyone’s hoping for boundaries with every ball; when he’s on the field, they’re cheering for wickets. Capturing these user-generated signals as they flow in, distilling them into an emoji swarm that mirrors the crowd’s mood, and displaying these shifting emotions live is a major challenge—especially with billions of emoji reactions anticipated over the tournament.

## Goal:
creating a horizontally scalable architecture using frameworks such as Kafka for data streaming and Spark for real-time data processing. The system will enable high concurrency and low latency, ensuring user interactions are seamless.
